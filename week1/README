Language: Python
Problem Statement:
App Category: Networking
DB: None

Simple part:
Create a web crawler app in python which, given a url seed, can crawl through all links on the page and scan deep for a given level of depth. While crawling the app should be able to return the url page containing a specific search text.

Input:
1 - Url seed e.g. www.hackernews.com
2 - Depth e.g. 5 (this means go into links on a page till 5 levels)
3 - search text e.g. "python"

Output:
the list of url that contains the specified text The Simple part is mandatory to be completed. If you finish the simple part and are eager to take up something challenging, then here's a little complex angle to the problem:

Complex part: (Optional, if you complete simple part and want to take up something more challenging)

Note: I have decided to do something original for the complex part rather than follow the guide on 50apps. For the original complex part, see the 50apps website

1) Multithreading
2) Result can be passed as parameter to allow consumption before search is done
